This is a fun little project inspired by the following YouTube video:

The idea is to generate 

I found the idea quite funny and interesting and decided to make my own version of the program - the way I would write and structure the code, plus do things the way I wanted to do. Working on this program also allowed me to code in Python and practice with it a little bit. Additionally, I learned more about using VS Code, working with extensions for it as well as using libraries for Python. 

Things you need to have before running the script:
1) MoviePy -> can be installed by using "pip install moviepy" command
2) ImageMagick -> can be downloaded from here https://imagemagick.org/

Python probably would need to be configured to point to the proper ImageMagick location. The config file should be located in the following folder:
{PathToPythonOnYourComputer}\Lib\site-packages\moviepy\config_defaults.py
